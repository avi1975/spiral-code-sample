Given a “n x m” array (n & m could be different or same numbers), print the contents of the array in a spiral order (i.e. print the outermost elements followed by the next inner layer followed by the next inner layer and so on until all elements are printed) in a clockwise manner. Note that all elements of the array should be printed only once.

The input could be either read from a text file or from a command prompt and the output should be printed on a console.

Example 1:

Array contents:

A b c d e 1  

F g h I j 2

K l m n o 3

P q r s t 4

Output: a b c d e 1 2 3 4 t s r q p k f g h l j o n l m

Example 2:

Array contents:

1   2   3   4

5   6   7   8

9 10 11 12

Output: 1 2 3 4 8 12 11 10 9 5 6 7
